1. The first project I have ever done in Python so far.
2. It is not production ready code, it is rather a vision, especially missing:
   - logging
   - right API shape
   - tests should clear database after every trip
3. Mock and integration tests written in Go.
4. Running integration tests:
```shell
make integration-test
```
